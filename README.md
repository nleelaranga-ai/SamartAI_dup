## 🚀 Overview

**SamartAI** is an accessibility-first AI platform that helps students discover government scholarships, understand eligibility, and receive step-by-step guidance—without navigating complex portals.

Unlike traditional scholarship portals that only list information, SamartAI **acts like a guide**.

Students access the same AI intelligence through:
- 🌐 a modern **Web Application**
- 💬 a lightweight **Telegram Bot**

👉 *Same intelligence. Different access. Maximum reach.*

## ❗ The Problem

Millions of eligible students miss scholarships not due to lack of merit, but because:
- Information is scattered across portals  
- Eligibility rules are complex and unclear  
- There is no personalized guidance  
- Language and digital literacy create barriers  
- Many students rely only on mobile devices  

**Information exists. Guidance doesn’t.**

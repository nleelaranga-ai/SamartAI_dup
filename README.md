## 🚀 Overview

**SamartAI** is an accessibility-first AI platform designed to help students discover **government scholarships**, understand **eligibility**, and receive **step-by-step guidance**—without navigating complex and fragmented portals.

Unlike traditional scholarship platforms that only list information, SamartAI **acts like a guide**.

Students can interact with the same AI intelligence through:
- 🌐 a modern **Web Application**
- 💬 a lightweight **Telegram Bot**

👉 *Same intelligence. Different access. Maximum reach.*

## ❗ Problem Statement

Despite the availability of numerous government scholarships, millions of students fail to benefit due to:

- Information scattered across multiple portals  
- Complex eligibility rules written in official language  
- Lack of step-by-step application guidance  
- Language and digital literacy barriers  
- Limited access to laptops or high-speed internet  

**Information exists. Guidance doesn’t.**
